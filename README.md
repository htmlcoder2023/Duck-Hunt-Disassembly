# Duck Hunt Disassembly

This is a disassembly of the Duck Hunt (World).nes ROM. It assembles with nesasm (https://github.com/ClusterM/nesasm) and creates a byte-for-byte perfect copy of the Duck Hunt (World).nes ROM. You must provide a copy of the 8KB duckhunt.chr file split from the Duck Hunt (World).nes ROM for this project to assemble in nesasm.


# TODO (This will take a while...)

1. Name each variable.
   
2. Name each label.
   
3. Decode the giant blobs of data.
   
4. Document the game's functions via comments.
